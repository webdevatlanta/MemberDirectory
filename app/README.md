# WebDevATL Member Directory

## What is it?
A directory of [WebDevATL](https://www.meetup.com/WebDevAtlanta/) members.
It runs [here](https://todo) (TODO: Deploy!)

## How does it work?

Members provide their profile as a GitHub
[Gist](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists). The
gist is used to build a profile card. The profile card shows the member's name, an
avatar, and a small plaintext blurb.

## How to add your profile
- [Create a new public gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- Complete the '_Gist description..._' and '_Filename including extension..._' fields. These fields are not used by the app, but should be meaningful to you.
- For the Gist content, enter some text. Describe yourself, use a oneliner, a
    movie quote, anything you like.
- Save the gist, and post your {{public name}} and the Gist URL to the WebDevATL [Slack channel](https://webdevatlanta.slack.com).

## For administrators
To add a new member, administrators open the
[memberlist.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/abrie/f33af17591e8ab04458cd76b3764f222/raw/64043f4194e60dc781c7a3dcc74b1eda3427769e/memberlist.js) gist and add a new dictionary to the memberlist array.


All Gists urls have the following format:
```https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{{username}}/{{gistid}}```

Follow this template, using the values defined above:
```
{
  "name":"{{public name}}",
  "github_username":"{{username}}",
  "gist_id":"${gistid}"
}
```

Save the gist. **If there is an error in the json, you'll see and error in the
console.**

# Contributing to Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
